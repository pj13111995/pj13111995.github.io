                From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God
                bless, my friends. I can't think of anything more rewarding than
                being able to express yourself to others through painting. I
                really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the
                'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Talk to trees, look at the
                birds. Whatever it takes.
              </p>

                How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your
                challenge for the day. This piece of canvas is your world. We'll
                play with clouds today.
              </p>

              <p>
                We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Put
                your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Nice little
                clouds playing around in the sky. We'll take a little bit of Van
                Dyke Brown.
