              From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God
              bless, my friends. I can't think of anything more rewarding than
              being able to express yourself to others through painting. I
              really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the
              'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Talk to trees, look at the
              birds. Whatever it takes.
            </p>

            <p>
              How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your
              challenge for the day. This piece of canvas is your world. We'll
              play with clouds today.
            </p>

            <p>
              We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Put your
              feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Nice little clouds
              playing around in the sky. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke
              Brown.

              Nothing wrong with washing your brush. It's hard to see things
              when you're too close. Take a step back and look. Maybe there's a
              happy little Evergreen that lives here.
            </p>

            <p>
              Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will
              happen. A fan brush can be your best friend. Let's make a happy
              little mountain now. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've
              done it this time.' And you may be right.
            </p>

            <p>
              Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you
              don't have to spend any time working or worrying. All you need to
              paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your
              mind. Just make a decision and let it go. Don't fiddle with it all
              day. There we are.
